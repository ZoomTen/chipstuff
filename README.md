# Chiptune scripting stuff

Python scripts to manipulate some chiptune tracker formats.

Admittedly, these were are result of scratching an itch of making music and
putting it in one of [the Pokemon disassembly projects][1], so they are mostly
geared towards that - though you can extend it if you want.
